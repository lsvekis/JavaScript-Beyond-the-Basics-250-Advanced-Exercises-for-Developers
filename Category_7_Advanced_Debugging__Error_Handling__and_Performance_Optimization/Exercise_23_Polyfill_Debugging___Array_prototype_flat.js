// Assume the polyfill from Exercise 17 is defined above
const testArray = [1, [2, [3, [4]]]];
const flattened = testArray.flat(3);
console.log(flattened); // Expected output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Explanation:
This exercise encourages you to test and verify that your polyfill correctly flattens nested arrays, ensuring it meets the expected behavior.
