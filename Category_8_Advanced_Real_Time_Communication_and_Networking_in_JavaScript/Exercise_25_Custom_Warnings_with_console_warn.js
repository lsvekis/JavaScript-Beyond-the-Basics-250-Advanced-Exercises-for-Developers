function deprecatedFeature() {
console.warn('Warning: deprecatedFeature() is deprecated and will be removed in future versions.');
// Fallback behavior for deprecated functionality
return 'Fallback result';
}

const result = deprecatedFeature();
console.log(result);

Explanation:
By explicitly warning developers when deprecated features are used, you promote better code maintenance and future-proofing.

This concludes Category 7: Advanced Debugging, Error Handling, and Performance Optimization with 25 exercises. Each exercise demonstrates a useful technique for writing robust, efficient, and maintainable JavaScript code. Experiment with these examples, modify them, and integrate these practices into your projects to improve your development workflow.
In this category, you’ll explore how to build real‑time, networked applications using browser‑provided communication protocols and APIs. These exercises cover WebSockets, Server‑Sent Events (SSE), WebRTC, long polling, and techniques for robust, secure, and efficient real‑time data transfer. Each exercise comes with complete code examples and detailed explanations—all using vanilla JavaScript.
