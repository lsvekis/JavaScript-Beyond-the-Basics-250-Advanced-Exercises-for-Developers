const name = 'Charlie';
const age = 25;
const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;
console.log(greeting);
// Output: "Hello, my name is Charlie and I am 25 years old."

Explanation:
Template literals (enclosed by backticks) allow embedding expressions using ${} for a more readable and dynamic string creation.
