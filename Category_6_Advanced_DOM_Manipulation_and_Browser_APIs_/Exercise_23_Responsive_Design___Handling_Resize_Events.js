window.addEventListener('resize', () => {
console.log(`Window size: ${window.innerWidth}x${window.innerHeight}`);
// Update layout or styles based on new dimensions
});

Explanation:
By monitoring the resize event, you can implement responsive adjustments or trigger re-renders when the window dimensions change.
